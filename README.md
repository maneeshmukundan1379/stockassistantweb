python stock_assistant_web.py
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:7860`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

- **Sleep after inactivity**: Free tier apps sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **First request delay**: First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- **Custom domain**: Free tier supports custom domains
- **HTTPS**: Automatic HTTPS included

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in Render dashboard:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
- `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` (optional, but recommended for better data)

### Port Configuration

The app automatically uses the `PORT` environment variable set by Render. No manual configuration needed!

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Chat interface** with message history
- **Copy button** on messages
- **Example questions** for quick start
- **Clear button** to reset conversation
- **Responsive design** works on mobile and desktop

## 📊 Example Questions

- "Should I buy Tesla?"
- "Healthcare stocks declining this month?"
- "When was NVIDIA highest?"
- "What are the top 3 technology stocks?"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### App not starting?
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all packages

### Port errors?
- The code handles this automatically via `PORT` env var
- No manual configuration needed

### Slow first request?
- This is normal on free tier (app wakes from sleep)
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on

### Import errors?
- Make sure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
- Check build logs for missing dependencies
